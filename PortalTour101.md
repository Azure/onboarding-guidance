# Module - Azure Portal Overview
# Background
Have you heard the buzz about the new Microsoft Azure Management Portal? The Silverlight app-based portal of yesterday has been replaced with a slick HTML5 website with much better accessibility from iPads, iPhones, and Android-based devices and is great from the desktop, too. Gone are the days of being able to browse your Azure-hosted website on your mobile device but not be able to check on your Web Role's status.

# Getting to the New Portal
You access the new portal the same way you've always accessed it.

# A Better Azure Portal
The new Microsoft Azure Management Portal, offers a much more streamlined approach to managing your Azure services, from a much broader array of clients than the previous version of the portal. I recommend you check out the portalâ€”the experience is truly many times better than the previous version.

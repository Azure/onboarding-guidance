# What is PowerShell?
PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool that can greatly expedite your admin tasks. PowerShell combines command-line speed, the flexibility of scripting, and the power of a GUI-based admin tool.

Azure PowerShell is a set of modules that provide cmdlets to manage Azure with Windows PowerShell. You can use the cmdlets to create, test, deploy, and manage solutions and services delivered through the Azure platform. In most cases, the cmdlets can be used for the same tasks as the Azure Management Portal, such as creating and configuring cloud services, virtual machines, virtual networks, and web apps. The cmdlets need your subscription so they can manage your services. Use your email address and password associated with your account. Azure authenticates and saves the credential information.

# Why do I want to use PowerShell?
Today, using PowerShell, it is possible to accomplish nearly everything from the command line that is possible in the Azure Portal. In fact, many tasks can only be performed using PowerShell, and some tasks can be managed more granularly using PowerShell. To provide the same support for working with Azure, PowerShell is also available to configure and manage many aspects of Microsoft Azure, including virtual machine and storage provisioning, and network configuration.

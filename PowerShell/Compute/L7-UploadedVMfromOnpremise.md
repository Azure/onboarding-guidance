# Abstract

During this module, you will learn how to upload a (Syspreped) image to Azure.

# Learning objectives
After completing the exercises in this module, you will be able to:
* Deploy a new VM from the captured image
* Get information regarding Storage Account
* Get information regarding Virtual Network
* Create a new IP Address

# Prerequisite 
* Completion of [Module on Storage](https://github.com/Azure/onboarding-guidance/tree/master/windows/Module%20I)
* A virtual machine running Windows - There are many tools for creating virtual machines on-premises.
For example, see [Install the Hyper-V Role and configure a virtual machine](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh846766.aspx).
To know which Windows operating systems are supported by Azure, see [Microsoft server software support for Microsoft Azure virtual machines.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2721672)

# How do I create a VM image from an existing Azure VM
Using Azure PowerShell create a generalized image of an existing Azure VM. You can then use the image to create another VM. This image includes the OS disk and the data disks that are attached to the virtual machine. The image doesn't include the virtual network resources, so you need to set up those resources when you create a VM using the image.

# Upload a Windows VM VHD (Lift and Shift) to Azure for Resource Manager deployments

## Make sure that the VM has the right file format


* Windows Server 2012 R2 (All Windows Update) - No Roles installed
* VHD size - 127 GB
* Enabled Remote Desktop
* WorkGroup VM - Check Windows Firewall for for Guest or Public Networks

1. Make sure you have the RDP enabled inside the VM.
2. Login to Windows server VM and then enable Remote Desktop Feature.
3. Verify the Remote Desktop feature is enabled in Windows Firewall for both Private and Public Profile.

Note â€“ If machine is part of domain, then make sure RDP is enabled for Domain Profile.

Click on "Allow Apps to communicate through Windows Firewall".

Steps :

To create or find an Azure storage account by using PowerShell
Open Azure PowerShell and sign in to your Azure account.


Login-AzureRmAccount
This command will open a pop-up window for you to enter your Azure credentials.

If the subscription ID that is selected by default is different from the one that you want to work in, use either of the following commands to set the right subscription.


Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
or
Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"

You can find the subscriptions that your Azure account has by using the command Get-AzureRmSubscription.

# What is PowerShell?
PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool that can greatly expedite your admin tasks. PowerShell combines command-line speed, the flexibility of scripting, and the power of a GUI-based admin tool.

Azure PowerShell is a set of modules that provide cmdlets to manage Azure with Windows PowerShell. You can use the cmdlets to create, test, deploy, and manage solutions and services delivered through the Azure platform. In most cases, the cmdlets can be used for the same tasks as the Azure Management Portal, such as creating and configuring cloud services, virtual machines, virtual networks, and web apps. The cmdlets need your subscription so they can manage your services. Use your email address and password associated with your account. Azure authenticates and saves the credential information.

# Why do I want to use PowerShell?
Today, using PowerShell, it is possible to accomplish nearly everything from the command line that is possible in the Azure Portal. In fact, many tasks can only be performed using PowerShell, and some tasks can be managed more granularly using PowerShell. To provide the same support for working with Azure, PowerShell is also available to configure and manage many aspects of Microsoft Azure, including virtual machine and storage provisioning, and network configuration.

# How to install and configure Azure PowerShell:-

-------------------

First Time installation  
WebAPI installer : [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx/getinstaller/WindowsAzurePowershellGet.3f.3f.3fnew.appids/)

Command Line : PowerShell Gallery

Note :  
* The WebPI installer will install the Azure modules in %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\PowerShell.  
* PowerShell Gallery modules will normally install in %ProgramFiles%\WindowsPowerShell\Modules. 


### Install Azure PowerShell from the PowerShell Gallery using an elevated ((Run as Administrator) Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) prompt using the following commands:

```PowerShell
# Check Basic Machine Info :-

Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object  Caption, InstallDate, ServicePackMajorVersion, OSArchitecture, BootDevice,  BuildNumber, LocalDateTime| FL

Caption                 : Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
InstallDate             : 4/4/2016 4:08:53 PM
ServicePackMajorVersion : 0
OSArchitecture          : 64-bit
BootDevice              : \Device\HarddiskVolume1
BuildNumber             : 10586
LocalDateTime           : 6/20/2016 3:26:53 PM

```



```PowerShell
# Check Environment Path Variable : -

$env:Path
C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\

$env:PSModulePath
C:\Users\test\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
```

To check is Azure PowerShell is already installed

```PowerShell
 C:\Windows\system32> Get-Module -ListAvailable Azure*
```

### Installing Azure PowerShell from the PowerShell Gallery (ARM)



```PowerShell
# Install the Azure Resource Manager modules from the PowerShell Gallery

PS C:\Windows\system32> Install-Module AzureRM -Verbose

NuGet provider is required to continue
PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The NuGet provider must be available in 'C:\Program
Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or 'C:\Users\aanan\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by running 'Install-PackageProvider
 -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install and import the NuGet provider now?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to
 install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): A
PS C:\Windows\system32>

```
Note : If an error occurs during install, you can manually remove the Azure* folders in your %ProgramFiles%\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder, and try the installation again.

### For Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 (You can skip this section if you are not using Windows Server )
```PowerShell
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object  Caption, InstallDate, ServicePackMajorVersion, OSArchitecture, BootDevice,  BuildNumber, LocalDateTime| FL


Caption                 : Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter
InstallDate             : 7/12/2016 12:37:03 PM
ServicePackMajorVersion : 0
OSArchitecture          : 64-bit
BootDevice              : \Device\HarddiskVolume2
BuildNumber             : 9600
LocalDateTime           : 7/14/2016 3:24:32 PM
```
Install-Module AzureRM will fail as  Note: Installing Azure PowerShell using PowerShellGet requires Windows Management Framework 5.0 (Windows 10 includes this by default).
```PowerShell
Error message :

Install-Module : The term 'Install-Module' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or
operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try

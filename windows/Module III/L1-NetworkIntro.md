# What is a Virtual Network?
Virtual Machines gives you lots of control over the virtual machines your small or multi-tier applications are running on â€“ as if the VMs were another rack in your datacenter. This learning path will help you understand how to create and manage VMs using the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and Resource Manager templates.
Azure Virtual Machines is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Typically, you'll choose a virtual machine if you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer.

# Why do I want to use Virtual Machines
An Azure virtual machine gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs the virtual machine. However, you still need to maintain the virtual machine -- configuring, patching, and maintaining the software that runs on the virtual machine.
